When the damage hits a non weakspot, the plane survives. All the planes that survive are the ones that have been hit in a non weakspot. Therefore, if we only look at the planes that survive, we will only see damage in non weakspots. This is because the planes that have been hit in weakspots have not survived. By armoring the visible damage, ie the non weakspot, we are conditioning our reasoning on the planes that have survived and hence are not dealing with the actual cause of planes not surviving."
