We obtained our climate data from the Government of Canada's Climate Data Online website. This data was broken down by various weather stations across Canada, which presented an opportunity to fine tune our data to specific regions. After obatining a map that showed the concentration of barley production in Canada from the USDA, we setteled on weather station data for Lethbridge in Alberta and Prince Albert in Saskatchewan. Further, we limited our data to the months of June to November, which is when barley is typically grown. Computing the average temperature and total rainfall for each year in those months giving us our climate data. The data from oth weather stations stretched all the way back to 1937, but unfortunately only had data till 2007.\n",
